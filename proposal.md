# Community Software Analysis Proposal

## Software: Landlab

Landlab is a Python package for numerically solving PDEs modeling processes on the earth's surface. It is primarily targeted at geomorphology, hydrology, glaciology, stratigraphy, and related fields. Landlab has a gridding engine and an immense library of models of physical processes, like erosion by flowing water and plant dynamics. Each process in the library is modular. This is part of one of the stated goals of the project - to help researchers work with a baseline of existing models so that they do not need to reinvent the wheel with every project. Finally, with that ethos of open science, the package contains a large number of tutorial notebooks.

### Notes/concerns/risks

My immediate concern with this project is that it it focused on applications to earth processes, a domain which I do not know very much about. While I chose this project because the application area was very interesting to me, I am worried that my lack of area knowledge may reduce my ability to contribute.

The project asks that contributions also be submitted to the Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System (CSDMS) Model Repository via email.
